 # Token
 
 There is a total of 8 tokens, 4 per team. Goal of the game is to make all 4 tokens make a full round trip of the board and com back home.
 
 There is no predeterimed token shape or material. Any objects that can easily differentiate teams will work, like coins, go, or even rocks.
 
 If your token arrives at station with opponent's token, your opponent's token has to restart.
 
 If multiple tokens of yours stop at same station, they can move together. It's faster way to win the game, but if you get caught by your opponent, there's a huge consequences!
 
 Since it is easy to draw the board and get objects as tokens, you can play the game without specialied equipment!
