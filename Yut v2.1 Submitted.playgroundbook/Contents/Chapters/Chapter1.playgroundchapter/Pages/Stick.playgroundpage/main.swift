 # Yut Sticks
 
 ![Combinations of Yut sticks](yut_combinations.jpg)
 
 To advance through stations on the board, you throw four Yut sticks just like a dice. Each stick has a front (flat side) and a back side (round side) and are made with wood.
 
 Number of fronts and backs determine how many stations you can advance. Each combination even has a unique name!
 
 * Do - One front. Advance one.
 * Gae - Two front. Advance two.
 * Geol - Three front. Advance three.
 * Yut - Four front. Advance four. Throw one more time.
 * Mo - Four back. Advance five. Throw one more time.
 
 Interestingly, each represents an animal, too.
 
 * Do - 🐖 Pig.
 * Gae - 🐕 Dog.
 * Geol - 🐑 Sheep.
 * Yut - 🐂 Cow.
 * Mo - 🐎 Horse.
 
 (Wait, does that mean the name of this game is "Cow" game? Huh)
 
 Try throwing the Yut sticks yourself! You can either shake your device or tap "Throw" button.
