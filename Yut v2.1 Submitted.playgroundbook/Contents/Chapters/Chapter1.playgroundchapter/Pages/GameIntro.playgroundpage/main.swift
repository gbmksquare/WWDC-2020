 # Yut
 
 Yut, pronounced "Yoot" (/juːt/), is a traditional board game in Korea. It is often played during Korean Lunar New Year's Day when family and relatives are gathered.
 
 In fact, I got the idea of making this playground this year, while playing Yut with my family!

 To here the pronunciation of "Yut", run the playground and hear the pronunciation.

 Also, yut is written as "윷" in Korea. Try to write the word with an Apple Pencil or your finger.
